## The Shader Runner
Implemented as a modifier.

### Platform specific implementation
The shader runner is platform specific: one for Android the other is for all the other platforms
using Skiko (Skia for Kotlin) as graphic engine. The shader language is *SkSL - Skia Shading Language*,
allowing to write one shader for all platforms.

### Inputs for the Shader
The shader runner delivers time and tap position.

## The Shader in the Video
is documented in the code.

## Build and Run

As usual from Android Studio.
